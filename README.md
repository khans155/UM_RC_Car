# AC-Series-Motor-Control-System---RC-Car
A custom 3D printed RC car powered by a universal (AC series) motor. This project includes the design of the vehicle chassis and drivetrain (axles, steering, and motor mounts), as well as programming an Arduino based microcontroller that decodes FlySky iBus receiver data to control motor speed and direction via a motor driver.
